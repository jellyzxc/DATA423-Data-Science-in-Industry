1 About the raw data

The raw data is from a CSV file without any introduction to the background.

2 The number of observations and variable types

This data frame has 300 observations of 44 variables. 
After we loaded all the data by read.csv() in R at the beginning, we found that there are only two data types: factor and numeric. 
The Date is a typical Datetime variable rather than a factor, 
and other variables like Priority, Price, Speed, Duration, and Temp with apparent orders should be ordinal variables. 
The types of these variables we mentioned need to be programmatically altered.
